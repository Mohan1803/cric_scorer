Privacy Policy 

App Name: Cric Scorer 

1. Information We Collect 

We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from users. The app is designed to function entirely offline and stores data only on your device unless otherwise stated. 
 
However, we may collect the following non-personal data: 
- Match data (teams, player names, scores) 
- App usage statistics (only if crash analytics or performance tracking is enabled through a third-party service, e.g., Firebase or Sentry) 

2. Use of Information 

Any data collected is used solely for the following purposes: 
- To provide the scorekeeping functionality within the app 
- To improve app performance and user experience (if analytics are enabled) 
- To allow saving, exporting, or sharing match data locally or as a PDF 
 
We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third parties. 

3. Data Storage and Security 

All user-generated match data is stored locally on your device. If you choose to export or share this data (e.g., via PDF or screenshots), you are responsible for how and where it is shared. 
 
We take reasonable measures to protect your information but cannot guarantee 100% security due to the nature of digital storage. 

4. Third-Party Services 

If the app uses third-party services (e.g., Firebase for crash reports), those services may collect certain data as per their own privacy policies. Please refer to their respective policies for more information. 

5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy 

Our app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, please contact us so we can promptly delete it.
